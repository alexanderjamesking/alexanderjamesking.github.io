      <description>As software evolves along with the languages and frameworks it is built upon, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to create a monster. This is the tale of tackling complexity at the heart of Exoscale, and how a data-driven approach with ClojureScript enabled us to seamlessly replace a JavaScript app without user outage.
At Dutch Clojure Days 2019 I spoke about some of our work at Exoscale, where we&amp;rsquo;ve been migrating a legacy Angular application to ClojureScript.</description>

      <description>An article I wrote for Exoscale explaining the differences between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous deployment, with an example showing how to setup a CircleCI pipeline that deploys to Exoscale following a successful build.

      <description>As of today, there are two main libraries used for testing in Clojure, clojure.test and Midje. clojure.test is extremely simple and it provides a very small API allowing you to write a basic test suite, Midje on the other hand is slightly more complex but it provides a wealth of features.
Spy is a library I have written that is aimed at clojure.test users, it can be used with both Clojure and ClojureScript.</description>

      <description>An implementation of minesweeper in ClojureScript, check out the source code on GitHub.
I drew all the graphics inline using SVG, rendering with React via Reagent.
I used Devcards to run the unit tests and to see what the UI components looked like in all states.</description>

      <title>Clojure from Java</title>

      <description>Working with XML is painful in Java, there are many options such as DOM, SAX, StAX, JAXB, XSLT but they&amp;rsquo;re all verbose compared to the equivalent code in Clojure where you can make use of Maps and Zippers.
In Clojure my approach is usually as follows:
Parse the XML into a map Navigate the map using a zipper Create a new map with the values we&amp;rsquo;re interested in Convert the new map to JSON This example follows the above process but calls the Clojure code from Java, ideally I&amp;rsquo;d wrap this up in a library but to keep things simple I&amp;rsquo;ve invoked the dependencies from Java prior to calling the transform library.</description>
